### Work Experience
**Data Analyst** _Teridion_ (October 2023 - Present)
- Acquired essential networking concepts and business acumen to enhance domain knowledge.
- Leveraged database systems, such as Google BigQuery, Neo4j, Elasticsearch. 
- Developed and implemented scripts to generate periodic reports, based on statistical models. 
- Improved the structure and efficiency of existing data pipelines, saving money for the company.
- Deployed Dataform as a version control solution for BigQuery to optimize query collaboration.
- Participated in board meetings, where I shared findings on emerging trends and coordinated with colleagues to develop innovative strategies aligned with our organizational vision.

**Simulation Engineer** _IDF_ (October 2019 - June 2022)
- Studied advanced topics in aerodynamics, particularly focused on missile dynamics & guidance.
- Programmed physical simulations infrastructure, coded primarily in Python, MATLAB, and C.
- Developed an interactive dashboard, designed for non-technical decision-makers, to create and present figures and metrics. The project is written in Python using Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Tkinter.
- Analyzed both directly measured and simulated data and visualized it for presentation purposes.
- Composed and formulated concluding reports detailing results from conducted experiments.
- Supported professionally fellow teams and collaborated on joint projects.

**Research Experience (part of the Ascola #ChallengeIL program)** _IBM_ ()
- Completed an introductory quantum computing course, instructed by the Israeli IBM research lab, acquiring necessary mathematical background, and knowledge regarding the Qiskit SDK.
- Studied the time-dependent dynamics of pulse-driven multi-qubit devices, accounting for decoherence and dissipation.
- Gathered crucial data and processed it, to reinforce the theoretical basis of the proposed model.


### Projects
## EDIT
#### IBM Data Science Capstone
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million USD; other providers cost upward of 165 million USD each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore determining if the first stage will land would also determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. The capstone evolved around predicting if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully.
